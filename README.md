# UFOs
Dana would like to have an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The interested criterias she would like to have are : date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs
   
 ## 1 UFOs observation events by date
   1/1/2010 seems to capture the most UFOs observation with 34 events across US, interesting that this is a new year day and whether what people observed is UFOs or fireworks      we need to do more detail interview in order to clarify 
 
   The 1/1/2020 date filter  is shown below :

 ## 2 Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
 
  In step 2, we have to make the process become automated . To do this we convert Jupyter Notebook code into scrap.py file and convert the jupyter code into hemisphere           function. In additional, we have to modified the index.html so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and   title for each hemisphere image. The result for this are shown below :

 ## 3 Add Bootstrap 3 Components
  Robin really impress with the web-app ,but she like to make it more stand out. To deliver this request we have to use the Bootstrap 3 components. We modified the index.html     so that the title "Mars Hemisphere" stand out with the format using jumbotron and h1. We also make the image display using thumpnail format with mixed: mobile and desktop of   col-md-3. The result for this are shown below :
