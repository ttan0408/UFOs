# UFOs
Dana would like to have an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The interested criterias she would like to have are : date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs
   
 ## 1 UFOs observation events by date
   1/1/2010 seems to capture the most UFOs observation with 34 events across US, interesting that this is a new year day and whether what people observed is UFOs or fireworks      we need to do more detail interview in order to clarify 
 
   The 1/1/2020 date filter  is shown below :

 ## 2 UFOs observation events by state
   California can be named as UFOs city because base on the data we analyzed it has more UFOs observation compare to other states. This seems to make sense since California is    one of the most population state. This may lead to a wrong interpretation that UFOs like to travel to California. 
   
  . The sumarry table base on state UFOs observation are shown below :

 ## 3 Add Bootstrap 3 Components
  Robin really impress with the web-app ,but she like to make it more stand out. To deliver this request we have to use the Bootstrap 3 components. We modified the index.html     so that the title "Mars Hemisphere" stand out with the format using jumbotron and h1. We also make the image display using thumpnail format with mixed: mobile and desktop of   col-md-3. The result for this are shown below :
