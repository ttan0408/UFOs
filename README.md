# UFOs
Dana would like to have an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The interested criterias she would like to have are : date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs
   
 ## 1 UFOs observation events by date
   1/1/2010 seems to capture the most UFOs observation with 34 events across US, interesting that this is a new year day and whether what people observed is UFOs or fireworks      we need to do more detail interview in order to clarify 
 
  The 1/1/2020 date filter  is shown below :

 ## 2 UFOs observation events by state
   California can be named as UFOs city because base on the data we analyzed it has more UFOs observation compare to other states. This seems to make sense since California is    one of the most population state. This may lead to a wrong interpretation that UFOs like to travel to California. 
   
  The sumarry table base on state UFOs observation are shown below :

 ## 3 UFOs shape
   In this analysis, the light shape UFOs seems to have the most observation with 26 reports. This is quite of interesting because light shape can be fireworks light ball. This    filtered events coincide with new year date 1/1/2010 when people celebrate with fireworks and mistakely reported as UFOs objects.
   The result for this are shown below :
